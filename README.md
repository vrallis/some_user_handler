# some_user_handler

### Some classes for a instragram copy cat I made for a uni porject. This code contains a user factory. An IO handler to handle tasks from the user database. Encrypts and salts passwords using SHA-256 encryption. Has a username and password validity checker and many more things.

Names for user creation I got from here: https://github.com/aruljohn/popular-baby-names
